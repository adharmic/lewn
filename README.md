# Overview
This crate is a simple implementation of Luhn's checksum validation algorithm.

It offers a few methods which may be helpful in creating/validating Luhn numbers, including a couple which can show the calculated checksums and check digits.

It is licensed under a CC0 license and may be used freely without accreditation.

# Notes
The package has only been tested by me. If there are any issues, please reach out at adithya@satyaloka.org.

Thanks for reading.
